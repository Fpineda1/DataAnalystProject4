# Data Analyst Project 4

Project 4 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program

For this project I gathered, assessed and cleaned data, specifically the data was from the weratedogs twitter account. The data used for this project are the following:
1. CSV file
2. Downloading a TSV file from a URL provied. 
3. Using the Twitter API I downloaded the favorites and retweets for all tweets listed in CSV file

I documented all wrangling and cleaning activites in the Wrangle_report.pdf

for the analysis I asked the following questions:

1. What was the average rating for dogs in this dataset? 
2. What is the relationship between retweets and favorites?
3. What are the top names within the dataset?
